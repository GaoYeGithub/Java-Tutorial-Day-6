## Project 6: Student Grades

Cogratglition for almost complete thing the week, today we will be using everything you learn to create a Student Grade checker.

*You can continue to use this same repl for your project. Just make sure you delete any previous code from our practice session.*

1. Create a list to store student names

<details><summary> ðŸ’¡Hint </summary> 
Remember to import everything you need.
</details>

2. Create dictionaries that ask that store Student Name and Grade

<details> <summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint </summary>
You can do either percent grade or letter grade up to you
</details>

3. Put everything in a while true loop that will look like this that check if user didn't type exit to leave

<details> <summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint </summary>
For user input use the scanner!
</details>

4. When the user finailly exit print both the name list and grades map

5. You can also pretty pretty print it it at the end

6. `Run` your program.

And it should look like this
```
Enter Student name or 'exit' to see everything: 
Gary
Enter grade percent for Gary
100
Enter Student name or 'exit' to see everything: 
exit

Student Names: [Gary]
Student Grade: {Gary=100}

Detailed Student Grades:
